This calculator takes in expressions one-by-one and calculates the answer until the user types "QUIT". It supports add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus, number and parenthesis expressions. The calculator takes the expressions in as infix expressions and converts them into a postfix tree structure using the composite pattern. The program iterates through the infix expression and uses a conversion algorithm that acts as the commander for a builder pattern that builds the composite, postfix tree node-by-node. Each node represents a mathematical expression including numbers or operations such as multiply or divide. A visitor pattern is used to traverse the expression using post-order traversal and executes the expression. This version also supports variables in the expression, which are assigned a value by the user when detected. The variables are stores in a hash-map with their values and are entered in the tree as number nodes using by referencing the hash-map during the infix-to-postfix conversion algorithm. All the methods/patterns are accessed through a wrapper/façade pattern called “Calculator”.
